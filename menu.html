        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p> The game aims to develop a classic Connect Four game with
          an implementation of an AI opponent. The game will allow users
          to play against computer-programmed AI which will be performed
          at a difficult level. The AI will employ Minimax algorithm
          and Alpha-beta prunning to enhance its gameplay, providing a
          challenging experience for players to win.
